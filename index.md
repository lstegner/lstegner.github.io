## About Me
I am a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the <a href="https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">People and Robots Laboratory</a>. I am broadly interested in robot control and programming interfaces, studying human needs, and developing robot applications that meet them. My current research applies these ideas to the domain of care robots to assist older adults.

Before grad school, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati in 2019. Part of our degree program included five co-operative education experiences, exposing me to a variety of industry and research positions.

In the summers of 2018 and 2019, I worked as an intern at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, supervised by Aman Mathur and Dr. Rupak Majumdar. We developed <a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/48217/9783030715007.pdf?sequence=1#page=184" target="_blank">Paracosm</a>, a test framework for autonomous driving simulations, published at FASE 2021.

### [Assistive Robots for Older Adults](./care-robots.html)
The combination of a rapidly aging population and growing shortage of caregivers had led to the rise in interest for assistive robots to help care for older adults and other vulnerable populations. This work seeks to understand how care robots can integrate into existing caregiving ecosystems. By understanding the needs and challenges of the end users, we can design, implement, and deploy more robust systems that have real-world use and validity.

### [Novel Programming Interfaces](./other-systems.html)
As robots become more commonly used in everyday scenarios, a wide range of individuals will need appropriate tools to easily and efficiently create programs that specify what their robot should do or how it should behave. This work seeks to make programming human robot interactions more natural for non-roboticists by employing programming language techniques, such as program synthesis, to translate multimodal user input into a full robot program.
